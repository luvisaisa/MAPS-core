# GUI Development Status

## Current State

The Tkinter-based GUI application has been implemented with core functionality:
- File and folder selection
- Batch processing
- Progress tracking
- Real-time logging
- Excel export

## Future Development

**Note**: This Tkinter GUI will be suspended in favor of a modern web-based interface.

### Planned Architecture

- **Backend**: FastAPI REST API (replacing direct parser calls)
- **Frontend**: React web application (replacing Tkinter GUI)
- **Benefits**: 
  - Cross-platform compatibility
  - Better UX/UI capabilities
  - Easier deployment
  - Real-time updates via WebSockets
  - No desktop installation required

### Timeline

GUI development suspended as of September 25, 2025.
Web interface development to begin in November 2025.

### Maintenance

The Tkinter GUI will remain functional for:
- Legacy users
- Offline use cases
- Quick local parsing tasks

Future enhancements will focus on the web interface.
