    # "CT" → "computed tomography"

get_all_forms(keyword) → List[str]
    # "pulmonary" → ["pulmonary", "lung", "pneumonic", "pulmonic"]

detect_multi_word_terms(text) → List[Tuple[str, int, int]]
    # "ground glass opacity" → [("ground glass opacity", 0, 20)]

filter_stopwords(tokens) → List[str]
    # ["the", "patient", "has", "nodule"] → ["patient", "nodule"]

normalize_characteristic_value(char, value) → str
    # ("subtlety", "5") → "obvious"
    # ("malignancy", "1") → "highly unlikely malignant"

get_anatomical_terms(region=None) → List[str]
    # region="lobes" → ["upper lobe", "middle lobe", "lower lobe", ...]

get_diagnostic_terms(category=None) → List[str]
    # category="benign" → ["granuloma", "hamartoma", "scar", ...]

normalize_batch(keywords) → Dict[str, str]
    # {"lung": "pulmonary", "CT": "computed tomography", ...}
```

**Lookup Map Building**:
- **synonym_map**: 83 bidirectional mappings (term → canonical)
- **abbreviation_map**: 26 abbreviation expansions
- **multi_word_set**: 120+ multi-word terms for phrase detection
- **stopwords**: 80+ medical and general stopwords

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Basic Normalization
```python
from src.maps.keyword_normalizer import KeywordNormalizer

normalizer = KeywordNormalizer()

# Synonym mapping
canonical = normalizer.normalize("lung")  # → "pulmonary"

# Abbreviation expansion
expanded = normalizer.normalize("CT")  # → "computed tomography"

# Combined
result = normalizer.normalize("GGO")  # → "ground glass opacity"
```

### Example 2: Synonym Expansion for Search
```python
# Get all forms for search query expansion
forms = normalizer.get_all_forms("pulmonary")
# → ["pulmonary", "lung", "pneumonic", "pulmonic"]

# Use in search query
for form in forms:
    search_database(form)
```

### Example 3: Multi-Word Term Detection
```python
text = "Patient has ground glass opacity in right upper lobe"
detected = normalizer.detect_multi_word_terms(text)
# → [("ground glass opacity", 12, 32), ("upper lobe", 42, 52)]
```

### Example 4: Stopword Filtering
```python
tokens = ["the", "patient", "has", "a", "pulmonary", "nodule"]
filtered = normalizer.filter_stopwords(tokens)
# → ["patient", "pulmonary", "nodule"]
```

### Example 5: Characteristic Value Normalization
```python
# Convert LIDC numeric values to descriptive text
desc = normalizer.normalize_characteristic_value("subtlety", "5")
# → "obvious"

desc = normalizer.normalize_characteristic_value("malignancy", "1")
# → "highly unlikely malignant"
```

### Example 6: Batch Processing
```python
keywords = ["lung", "CT", "lesion", "mass", "GGO"]
normalized = normalizer.normalize_batch(keywords)
# → {"lung": "pulmonary", "CT": "computed tomography", 
#     "lesion": "nodule", "mass": "nodule", 
#     "GGO": "ground glass opacity"}
```

### Example 7: Anatomical Terms
```python
# Get all lobes
lobes = normalizer.get_anatomical_terms('lobes')
# → ["upper lobe", "middle lobe", "lower lobe", ...]

# Get all airways
airways = normalizer.get_anatomical_terms('airways')
# → ["trachea", "carina", "main bronchus", ...]
```

### Example 8: Diagnostic Terms
```python
# Get benign terms
benign = normalizer.get_diagnostic_terms('benign')
# → ["granuloma", "hamartoma", "scar", ...]

# Get malignant terms
malignant = normalizer.get_diagnostic_terms('malignant')
# → ["adenocarcinoma", "metastasis", "lymphoma", ...]
```

## Integration with XMLKeywordExtractor

The normalizer can be integrated with the XML keyword extractor for enhanced extraction:

```python
from src.maps.xml_keyword_extractor import XMLKeywordExtractor
from src.maps.keyword_normalizer import KeywordNormalizer

# Create extractor with normalizer
normalizer = KeywordNormalizer()
extractor = XMLKeywordExtractor()

# Extract keywords
keywords = extractor.extract_from_xml("sample.xml", store_in_db=False)

# Normalize extracted keywords
for kw in keywords:
    canonical = normalizer.normalize(kw.text)
    print(f"{kw.text} → {canonical}")
```

---

## Performance

### Dictionary Loading
- **Load time**: <100ms (JSON parsing + map building)
- **Memory footprint**: ~2MB (650+ lines JSON + lookup maps)

### Normalization Speed
- **Single keyword**: <0.01ms (hash map lookup)
- **Batch (10 keywords)**: <0.1ms
- **Multi-word detection**: <5ms per sentence

### Lookup Map Sizes
- **Synonym map**: 83 entries (bidirectional)
- **Abbreviation map**: 26 entries
- **Multi-word set**: 120+ entries
- **Stopwords**: 80+ entries

---

## Known Issues

### 1. Multi-Word Term Detection (Test 4)
**Issue**: Overlapping multi-word terms not fully detected

**Example**:
- Text: "right upper lobe"
- Expected: "right upper lobe" (3 words)
- Actual: "upper lobe" (2 words)

**Root Cause**: Algorithm matches longest terms first, but doesn't handle overlaps where a longer term contains a shorter term

**Impact**: Minor - still detects valid medical terms, shorter versions

**Recommendation**: Implement overlap detection with priority for longer matches:
```python
# Prioritize longer matches and check for overlaps
detected = []
positions_used = set()

for term, start, end in sorted_matches:
    # Check if any position already used
    if not any(pos in positions_used for pos in range(start, end)):
        detected.append((term, start, end))
        positions_used.update(range(start, end))
```

### 2. Case Sensitivity
**Issue**: Current implementation lowercases all text, losing original case

**Impact**: Minimal - medical terms are case-insensitive for matching

**Recommendation**: Preserve original case in output if needed:
```python
def normalize(self, keyword: str, preserve_case: bool = False) -> str:
    normalized = self._normalize_internal(keyword.lower())
    if preserve_case and keyword.isupper():
        return normalized.upper()
    return normalized
```

## Integration with Database

The normalizer integrates with `KeywordRepository` for database-stored synonyms:

```python
from src.maps.database.keyword_repository import KeywordRepository

# Create normalizer with database connection
repo = KeywordRepository()
normalizer = KeywordNormalizer(keyword_repo=repo)

# Add custom synonym to database
repo.add_synonym(
    keyword_id=1,
    synonym_text="pulmonary lesion",
    normalized_form="nodule"
)

# Normalizer will now use database synonyms
result = normalizer.normalize("pulmonary lesion")
# → "nodule" (from database)
```
